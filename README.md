# A Complex Quasi-Newton Proximal Method for Image Reconstruction in Compressed Sensing MRI
Python implementation of [Tao Hong](https://hongtao-argmin.github.io), [Luis Hernandez-Garcia](http://fmri.research.umich.edu/about/faculty/hernandez.php), and [Jeffrey A. Fessler](https://web.eecs.umich.edu/~fessler/), ``[A Complex Quasi-Newton Proximal Method for Image Reconstruction in Compressed Sensing MRI](https://arxiv.org/abs/2303.02586)'', To appear in IEEE Transactions on Computational Imaging, 2024.

demo.py: the reconstruction of different algorithms on spiral and radial acquisitions using wavelet or/and TV regularizers.  

demoGamma.py and demoInnerIter.py: check the robustness of the parameters in our method.

Please shoot me an email (tahong@umich.edu) if you have challenges to use our code or find any bugs.
